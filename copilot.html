        <p>
            As TikTok developed an AI assistant for its monetization products, I was privileged with the task of leading its brand development. Working closely with the content design team, we launched the branding sprint with a workshop inviting teammates to share and vote on images, keywords, and ideas expressing their vision for the AI product.<br><br>
            Based on the workshop and following design iterations, we narrowed down the design direction to two potential approaches. The first leaned on the "sparkle" icon commonly used to represent AI technology, presenting the AI product as enterprise, smart, and sophisticated. On the other hand, the second direction represented the AI Assistant as a characterized helper, presenting it as expressive, amicable, and approachable. The direction of the AI character was ultimately chosen, as it best aligns with TikTok's more lighthearted brand and infuses a touch of fun and expression into the product.
            <br><br>
            The color wave we landed on for the logo mark was a smooth gradient between the pink and purple-blue colors of our data visualization color palette. This kept the logo's colors closely tied to the Keystone design system colors while keeping it distinct and unique. The pink and purple-blue also blend nicely to align with the Keystone's secondary color purple, which has been allocated for AI related icons and UI. The choice of purple also aligns with the industry trend of purple to showcase AI "magic".
