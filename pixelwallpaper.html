        <p>
        Google Pixel is a long-term partner of B-Reel. I was on the team that created the interactive wallpapers found in the Pixel 4, 4a and 5.  Showcased here are a couple concepts I designed from start to finish.
        <br><br>
        The Pinball wallpaper consists of dynamic 'marbles' that roll along the wallpaper and interact with the user as the user taps and swipes across the screen. The composition interacts with the Pixel 4a's unique hardware design - namely the front selfie camera located on the top left corner of the screen. New marbles are released from the camera hole and follow the connected paths.
        <br><br>
        Conveyor belt was a wallpaper designed for the Pixel 5 release. The wallpaper is essentially a slowly moving conveyor belt of objects that move in and out of screen over time. Different phone interactions bring in different special animated objects into view. For instance, playing music will bring in a mini radio, setting an alarm will pull in a clock, and turning your phone on airplane mode will bring in a bouncing airplane. Other animated objects appear on screen depending on the time of day. For instance, in the mornings a coffee or tea cup will appear, while at lunch time, a sandwich will slide into view. 
        <br><br>
        The Constellations wallpaper was an archived concept from earlier creative explorations.
