        Los Angeles Community Fridges (LACF) is a network of decentralized, independent refrigerators and pantries providing food and vital supplies to our communities through mutual aid. On a weekly basis, community volunteers work to help clean, maintain and restock these public fridges to help feed the unhoused and underresourced neighbors. Food is often sourced from donations or grocery stores and restaurants looking to redistribute their excess produce and reduce food waste. 
        <br><br>
        In 2022, I had the privilege to help design some apparel, stickers and print assets for LACF's 2 year anniversary. In previous years, some friends and I have been able to help paint some of the fridges installed around LA.
