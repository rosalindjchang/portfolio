        <p>
        After Hours is a series of events hosted by B-Reel featuring work by local artists. <br><br>I had the pleasure of creating an interactive illustration for the website of our second installment of After Hours. Using Paper.js, I created a minimalist drawing intertwining technology's mechanical structure with the organic form and motion of human interaction. This concept was designed to echo the content of the night, which was a mix of a retro VR experience, a talk by Curime Batliner on his robotic work, and myself presenting an interactive zine addressing the often intangible and ambiguous experience of mental illness. <br><br>Each browser refresh renders a new composition which can be altered through mouse interaction.
