        <p>
        After Hours is a series of open house events hosted by B-Reel featuring talks and work by local artists and designers. <br><br>I had the pleasure of creating an interactive illustration for the website and promo material for our second installment of After Hours this past December. Using Paper.js, I created a minimalist drawing intertwining technology's mechanical structure with the organic form and motion of human interaction. This concept was designed to echo the content of the night, which was a mix of a retro VR experience, a talk by Curime Batliner on his robotic work, and myself presenting an interactive zine capturing the often intangible and ambiguous experience of mental illness and emotions. <br><br>Each browser refresh renders a new composition which can be altered using mouse interaction.
