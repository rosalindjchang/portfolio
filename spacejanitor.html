        <p>
        Earlier in 2019, B-Reel created a few fictional game demo concepts for Google Maps Enduro, an API that allows game developers to use Google Maps data to build worlds based off real cities and locations. One of the game demos we created revolved around a Space Janitor who came to save Earth from asteroids by vacuuming up city buildings to safety. The Google Maps Platform team became huge fans of Space Janitor and came back to us with the ask of bringing the game to real life.

        It was an immensely collaborative project with components ranging from UX and game design to pixel art and 3D fabrication. We were also tasked to create a physical arcade cabinet to house an exclusive arcade version of the game. As one of the designers on the team I played a main role in designing the UI and physical arcade cabinet.
