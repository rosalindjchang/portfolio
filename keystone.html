        <p>
            Keystone is TikTok's new design system for monetization products. As the core Keystone team, we revamped the previous design system for a more consistent and streamlined, as well as visually enhanced and distinct experience across TikTok's monetization products. <br><br>
            As part of the core team, I played a key role in component design, guidelines and documentation. In the implementation phase, I also worked closely with developers and product designers to apply Keystone effectively across TikTok's monetization products, such as TikTok Ad Manager. <br><br>Reach out to see more regarding this project.
